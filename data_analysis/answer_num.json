The weight of an object on a given planet can be found by using the formula W = mg, where W is the weight of the object measured in newtons, m is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and g is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in \\frac{m}{sec^2}. What is the weight, in newtons, of an object on Mercury with a mass of 90 kilograms?",
