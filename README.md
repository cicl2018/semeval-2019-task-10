## Notes
#### 22.11.2018
- Get statistics of the training data > Henry
- Try to use machine learning for:
  1. raw strings and answers (some sort of numeric prediction) > Jonah
  2. raw strings and logical forms 
- Papers and systems available so far > Alina
- As we might need more data for a statistical approach, the existing data can be extended half-manually

#### 14.11.2018
- statistical approach
- semantic representations
- it's not necessary to deal with all the types of questions, it's better to start with Closed-vocabulary algebra and Open-vocabulary algebra types
- if we don't have time for image processing, we can ignore this type of questions or try to come up with a program that would be a bit better than a simple guesser

### The CodaLab competition page

[https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20013]

### Task Overview

Over the past four years, there has been a surge of interest in math question answering. In this SemEval task, we provide the opportunity for math QA systems to test themselves against a benchmark designed to evaluate high school students: The Math SAT (short for Scholastic Achievement Test).

The training and test data consists of unabridged practice exams from various study guides, for the (now retired) exam format administered from 2005 to 2016. We have tagged questions into three broad categories:
- Closed-vocabulary algebra, e.g. "Suppose 3x + y = 15, where x is a positive integer. What is the difference between the largest possible value of y and the smallest possible value of x, assuming that y is also a positive integer?"
- Open-vocabulary algebra, e.g. "At a basketball tournament involving 8 teams, each team played 4 games with each of the other teams. How many games were played at this tournament?"
- Geometry, e.g. "The lengths of two sides of a triangle are (x-2) and (x+2), where x > 2. Which of the following ranges includes all and only the possible values of the third side y?"

A majority of the questions are 5-way multiple choice, and a minority have a numeric answer. Only the Geometry subset contains diagrams.

### Provided Datasets

We provide over 2200 training questions, 500 development questions, and 1000 test questions, all derived from Math SAT study guides. Questions are stored as JSON, using LaTeX to encode mathematical formatting.

```

### Gold Logical Forms

Additionally, we provide gold logical forms for a majority of the training questions in the Closed Algebra track. These logical forms are the same language used in the paper: 

Hopkins, M., Petrescu-Prahova, C., Levin, R., Le Bras, R., Herrasti, A., & Joshi, V. (2017). Beyond sentential semantic parsing: Tackling the math sat with a cascade of tree transducers. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 795-804). [(pdf)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c22a/240d1087603664826e9aab809273ed9bff15.pdf?_ga=2.52187753.1130679049.1530133172-566539276.1446829155&_gac=1.6555398.1527028246.EAIaIQobChMI9YuywK-a2wIVlcBkCh0WKw_kEAAYASAAEgKwgPD_BwE)

The logical form language is described [here](https://github.com/allenai/semeval2019-task10/blob/master/docs/logicalFormLanguage.md).
Competitors are free to ignore the provided logical forms if desired. Evaluation will be based solely on a system's ability to answer questions correctly. Competitors will also be free to use additional publicly available math training questions, like AQuA or MAWPS; we ask only that competitors refrain from using additional Math SAT questions found on the web or elsewhere, to avoid potential train/test overlap.

The logical forms are [here](https://github.com/allenai/semeval-2019-task-10/blob/master/interpreter/data/goldLogicalForms_closedAlgebra.json).

We also provide an interpreter for these logical forms. For instructions on how to use the logical form interpreter, see the guide [here](https://github.com/allenai/semeval-2019-task-10/tree/master/interpreter).

### Evaluation

Evaluation will be based solely on a system's ability to answer questions correctly.

For each subtask, the main evaluation metric will simply be question accuracy, i.e. the number of correctly answered questions. The evaluation script takes as input a list of JSON datum { id: \<id\>, response: "\<response\>"}, where \<id\> is the integer index of a question and \<response\> is the guessed response (either a choice key or a numeric string). It will output the systemâ€™s score as the number of correct responses divided by the total number of questions in the subtask.

While the main evaluation metric includes no penalties for guessing, we will also compute a secondary metric called penalized accuracy that implements the actual evaluation metric used to score these SATs. This metric is the number of correct questions, minus 1/4 point for each incorrect guess. We include this metric to challenge participants to investigate high-precision QA systems.

### Terms and Conditions

By submitting results to this competition, you consent to the public release of your scores at the SemEval-2018 workshop and in the associated proceedings, at the task organizers' discretion. Scores may include, but are not limited to, automatic and manual quantitative judgments, qualitative judgments, and such other metrics at the task organizers' discretion. You accept that the ultimate decision of metric choice and score value is that of the task organizers. You further agree that the task organizers are under no obligation to release scores and that scores may be withheld if it is the task organizers' judgment that the submission was incomplete, erroneous, deceptive, or violated the letter or spirit of the competition's rules. Inclusion of a submission's scores is not an endorsement of a team or individual's submission, system, or science.
