- A simple code I found online which can produce numbers form a input string, such as input "123+23" then the output would be "146". I have changed to three numbers additon or changed "+" into "add" or "add" and "minus" at the same time and worked well

- paper is here [Leaning to Execute](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.4615.pdf)
- code is [here](https://github.com/wojciechz/learning_to_execute), but it is writen in lua.

- I will try this model with our data. See if it works.
